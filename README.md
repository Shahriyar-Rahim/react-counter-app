# React_Counter_App

## Project Title: A Simple Counter App

## Description

This is a minimalist and interactive counter application built with React.js. It allows users to easily increment, decrement, and reset a numerical count. Designed for simplicity and clarity, it serves as a great example of basic state management in a React application.

## Live Demo

You can interact with the live application here: [https://react-counter-app-indol-phi.vercel.app/]

## Features

* **Increase Count:** Click a button to increment the counter's value.
* **Decrease Count:** Click a button to decrement the counter's value.
* **Reset Count:** A dedicated button to instantly reset the counter back to zero.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using modern web development tools and libraries:

* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* **ESLint:** For maintaining code quality and consistency.

### Development Dependencies from `package.json`:

* `@tailwindcss/vite`
* `react`
* `react-dom`
* `tailwindcss`
* `@eslint/js`
* `@types/react`
* `@types/react-dom`
* `@vitejs/plugin-react`
* `autoprefixer`

## Installation and Local Setup

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shahriyar-Rahim/react-counter-app.git
    cd react-counter-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).

4.  **Build for production (optional):**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready build.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see a central display showing the current count. There will be three buttons: one to increase the count, one to decrease it, and one to reset it to zero. Simply click the respective buttons to perform the desired action.
